# My Personal Website

This is the code used for my personal website found at [jamiehudson.netlify.app](https://jamiehudson.netlify.app/). 

It is created using blogdown and Hugo based off the tutorial by [Dan Quintana](https://twitter.com/dsquintana/status/1139846569623281664), though plenty of other examples and tutorials can be found [here](https://academic-demo.netlify.app/), [here](https://www.kirenz.com/post/2019-07-20-up-and-running-with-blogdown/), and [here](https://georgecushen.com/create-your-website-with-hugo/).
