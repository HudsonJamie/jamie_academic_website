I am a Data Scientist utilising Natural Language Processing to gain insights from unstructured datasets. This is quite a change from my previous career, where I was  a Postdoctoral Research Fellow using genomic tools to further understand population connectivity in the oceans and help mitigate the detrimental effects of climate change.
