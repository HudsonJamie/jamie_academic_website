I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Southampton, working within the [Rius Lab Group](http://riuslab.com/).

My current research uses genomic tools to futher understand population connectivity in the oceans and help mitigate the deterimental effects of climate change, as part of the [futureMARES research project](https://www.futuremares.eu/)
