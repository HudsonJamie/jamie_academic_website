I am a Data Scientist utilising Natural Language Processing to gain insights from unstructured datasets. With a background in academic research, I have a deep understanding of the statistical analyses and research methodologies required to perform high-quality work, ranging from internal deliveries to peer-reviewed academic publications. In addition, I have a passion for data visualisation and enjoy using creative techniques to convey complex insights in a simple, intuitive (and fun) manner.
