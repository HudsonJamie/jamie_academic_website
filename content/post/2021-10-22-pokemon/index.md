There is a plethora of Pok√©mon data visualisation online, with much providing informative insights on specific Pok√©mon stats (HP, Attack, Sp. Atk etc). I thought it would be interesting to visualise the different "type" that each Pok√©mon is.

I downloaded a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/maca11/all-pokemon-dataset) that contains the typing of each Pok√©mon (some Pok√©mon have two types), and used *{geom_tile}* to produce a tile representing each Pok√©mon, where the colour of the tile maps to each Pok√©mon's typing.
