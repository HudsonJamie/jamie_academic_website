## Football data :soccer:

I have produced an R Shiny App with an updating [2021 / 2022 Premier League Table](https://jamie-hudson.shinyapps.io/premier-league-table-2021-22/) 

With this, you can view:

1) The Premier League Table at a set date

2) The Premier League Table between two dates - the media love to do this to see, for example, the table since Christmas or since a managerial sacking

3) A lineplot of the weekly league position for each team

4) A lineplot of the total number of points attained by each team, on a weekly basis. 

*The previous version for 2020/21 can be found here: [Premier League Table](https://jamie-hudson.shinyapps.io/premier-league-table/)*

**Please note that I only have a free shinyapps account, so use is limited to 25 active hours per month**
